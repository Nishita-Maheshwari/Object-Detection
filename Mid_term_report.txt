INTRODUCTION TO NUMPY 

 Numpy is an open source numerical Python library. 
 Numpy contains a multi-dimensional array and matrix data structures. 
 It can be utilised to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical and algebraic routines. 
 Numpy is an extension of Numeric and Numarray. 
 The library contains a large number of mathematical, algebraic and transformation functions. 
 It also contains random number generators. 
 Numpy is a wrapper around a library implemented in C. 
 Pandas objects heavily relies on Numpy objects. Pandas extends Numpy. 
 
INTRODUCTION TO ARGPARSE
  
Parser for command line options, arguments and subcommands.
This python module makes easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces.
The program defines what arguments it requires.
Argparse will figure out how to parse those out of sys. argv. 

INTRODUCTION TO OPEN CV WITH PYTHON 

Open CV was started at Intel in 1999 by Gary Brodsky and the first release came out in 2000. 
Open CV supports a lot of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
It is expanding day-by-day. 
Currently Open CV supports a wide variety of programming languages like C++, Python, and Java etc.
It is available on different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, iOS etc.
Also, interfaces based on CUDA and Open CV are also under active development for high-speed GPU operations. 
Open CV-Python is the Python API of Open CV. 
It combines the best qualities of Open CV C++ API and Python language. 
  
INTRODUCTION TO YOLO ALGORITHM 

YOLO (You Only Look Once)  

YOLO uses deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for object detection.
It stands out from its “competitors” because, as the name indicates it only needs to “see” each image once.
This allows YOLO to be one of the fastest detection algorithms (naturally sacrificing some accuracy). 
Thanks to this swiftness YOLO can detect objects in real time (up to 30 FPS).
