 # GLA UNIVERSITY MATHURA 2019
 # MINI PROJECT SYNOPSIS:
 # OBJECT DETECTION
 # About the Project:
Object Detection can be done in OpenCV .It aims to detect object.It is the process of finding real-world object instances like car, bike, TV, flowers, and humans in still image. It allows for the detection of multiple objects within an image which provides us with  much better understanding of an image.
Every Object Detection Algorithm has a different way of working, but they all work on the same principle.
Feature Extraction: They extract features from the input images at hands and use these features to determine the class of the image.Be it through MatLab, Open CV, Viola Jones or Deep Learning. In this project I will work on YOLO Object Detection with OpenCV and Python

#  Motivation: 
The motive of object detection is to recognize and locate (localize) all known objects in a scene.Object detection is breaking into a wide rangeof industries with use cases ranging from personal security to productivity in the workplace.


# Future Prospects:
  Tracking objects,
  Anomaly detection,
  Identity verification of object
  
# Requirements:

# Hardware:
   Computer system with minimum 4GB of RAM


# Software:
   Python,
   Numpy,
   YOLO,
   OpenCV Python
